# Instructions 

**1. Setting Up the Environment:**

* **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can check by running `python --version` in your terminal.
* **Virtual Environment (Optional):** It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Use tools like `venv` or `conda` to create one. Activate the virtual environment before proceeding.

**2. Creating the Project Structure:**

* Create a new directory for your project.
* Inside the project directory, create a Python file named `main.py`. This file will contain the API code.

**3. Installing Dependencies:**

* Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
* Create a file named `requirements.txt` with the following content:

```
fastapi
pydantic
numpy
joblib
uvicorn
logging
random
time
hashlib
```

* Run the following command in your terminal to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Writing the Code:**

* Open the `app.py` file in your preferred text editor or IDE.

**5. Importing Libraries:**

* At the beginning of `app.py`, import the required libraries as shown in the provided code. Each library serves a specific purpose.

**6. Loading the Model:**

* Use `joblib.load` to load the pre-trained SVC model from a file named `svc_model.pkl`. This file should be present in your project directory. Make sure to replace the filename if yours differs.
* Implement error handling using `try-except` block to catch potential loading issues.

**7. Creating the FastAPI App:**

* Initialize a FastAPI app instance using the `FastAPI` class. You can provide a title, description, and contact information to document your API.

**8. Defining Data Models (Optional):**

* Create Pydantic model classes to represent the features (sepal and petal lengths/widths) used for prediction and potentially the request/response structure. This provides data validation and clarity.

**9. Unique Code Signature (Optional):**

* Define a variable `CODE_SIGNATURE` using `hashlib.md5` to generate a unique identifier for your code version. 

**10. API Endpoints:**

* The code defines several API endpoints using the `@app.X` decorator, where X can be `post`, `get`, etc., specifying the HTTP method.
* **predict:** Accepts a single iris feature set as input and returns the predicted species.
* **predict_batch:** Accepts a batch of iris features and returns predictions for each flower.
* **predict_random:** Generates random features, predicts the species, and returns both the features and prediction.
* **health_check:** Returns a simple message indicating the API is healthy.
* **model_info:** Provides information about the model used for prediction.
* **simulate_workload (optional):** Simulates workload for testing purposes.

**11. Running the API:**

* At the end of the code, you'll find the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
* Configure logging using `logging.basicConfig`.
* Use `uvicorn.run` to start the API server on port 8000 by default.

**Additional Notes:**

* Remember to adjust the `svc_model.pkl` filename if your pre-trained model is named differently.
* You can customize the endpoints and functionalities as needed.

By following these steps and understanding the code structure, you can successfully create the Iris Flower Classification API using FastAPI and Python.
